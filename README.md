Project 1 - London bike hires and covid restrictions
This project uses data from the London bike hire scheme (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires) and about COVID restrictions (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/covid-19-restrictions-timeseries).
This project aims to discover the effect upon bike hire usage given the three elements of the COVID response: Work From Home, Rule of 6 Indoors, and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.

Project 2 â€“ Book Sales
This project aims to examine data from an e-book publishing company. The data provided contains information on e-book sales over a period of many months. Each row in the data represents one book. The values of the variables are taken across the entire time period, so daily.sales is the average number of sales (minus refunds) across all days in the period, and sale.price is the average price for which the book sold in the period. This project shall discover:
1. The correlation between the books sales and their average review scores as well as total number of reviews.
2. The effect of sale price upon the number of sales, and if this effect is different across genres.
